  - Idea for vite plugin stolen from: https://github.com/gongfudev/new-astro-repo/tree/main

- I also tested this out with tailwind class based darkmode to switch between shoelace's default dark and light themes, and it was relatively simple, just copy paste the dark theme css into a `global.css` and put it in the `html.dark` selector

- About 20kb of js and 5kb css for the tooltip
